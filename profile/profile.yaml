summary: "I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from Carleton University with a post-graduate certificate  in Database Application Development from Seneca with prior experience as a full-stack developer. I am currently working in Teranet as a software developer mainly prioritising in fixing defects for the application. Some of my noticeable acclompishments while working include increasing space and time complexity in fetching large filings. Previously, I worked at Cancard INC as a full stack developer working on a database normalization project with a tight completion timeline. In doing so, I learned to thrive in a fast paced environment,  communicate with diverse stakeholders, and grasp new technical concepts quickly. I am hoping to find a place to develop my career further as a backend software engineer."
